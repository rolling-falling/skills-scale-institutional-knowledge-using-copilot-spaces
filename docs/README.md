# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Welcome

This is the central entry point for all OctoAcme project management process documentation. Whether you're a new team member onboarding or an experienced practitioner seeking guidance, start here to navigate our project management methodology and resources.

## Our Methodology

OctoAcme's project management approach balances structure with flexibility, enabling teams to deliver value iteratively while maintaining clear accountability and communication. Our methodology is grounded in these core practices:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has defined roles with a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Effective communication**: Maintain transparent, regular updates with stakeholders
- **Proactive risk management**: Identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle

## Five-Phase Lifecycle

Every OctoAcme project follows a structured lifecycle that ensures quality, alignment, and continuous improvement:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan
2. **Planning** — Turn the approved initiative into an actionable plan with clear backlog and timelines
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables with regular tracking
4. **Release** — Deploy to production with proper validation, communication, and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
