# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- **Facilitator**: Project Manager (remains neutral, focuses on process)
- **Attendees**: Core delivery team (Developers, QA Engineer, UX Designer, Technical Writer as applicable)
- **Optional attendees**: Product Manager, Release Manager, Customer Support Liaison (depending on sprint scope)
- **Timebox**: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- **Use an anonymous idea board** if needed to encourage candor (e.g., Miro, Retrium)
- **Prioritize 2–3 top action items** to avoid overload
- **Rotate facilitator** occasionally to get different perspectives

**Retrospective Roles:**
- **Facilitator** (Project Manager): Guides discussion, maintains psychological safety
- **Scribe** (rotate among team): Documents insights and action items
- **Participants** (all team members): Share observations honestly and constructively

## Tracking Improvements
- **Add action items to the project backlog** or issues with clear owners and timelines
- **Owner assignment by role:**
  - Process improvements: Project Manager
  - Technical debt: Tech Lead or Developers
  - Testing improvements: QA Engineer
  - Documentation improvements: Technical Writer
  - Design/UX improvements: UX Designer
  - Tooling/automation: Developers or Release Manager
  - Communication improvements: Project Manager or Product Manager
  - Metrics/analytics improvements: Data Analyst
- **Review outstanding actions** in the weekly PM sync
- **Track completion rate** and celebrate wins
- **Escalate blocked actions** if not progressing

**Accountability**: Project Manager tracks all retrospective action items and ensures owners are following through.
